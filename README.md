# TicketsShortcut-ASP-MVC-Website

### What is it?
As part of an assignment I created a fully functional ASP.Net MVC ticket selling website, built and tested, which pulled and pushed data from and to an SQL database.

Functionalities include:
* Razor (cshtml) pages created to represent the front-end of the website using ASP.Net Model-View-Controller
* Ability to view (search by keyword), update, create and delete data from an SQL database connected to the website
